\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the functionalities and requirements of CodeKataBattle (CKB), a novel platform designed to facilitate the enhancement of students' software development skills through collaborative training on code katas. Educators leverage this platform to challenge and mentor students by creating code kata battles, where teams of students engage in friendly competitions to showcase and enhance their programming skills.


\subsection{Scope}
Nowadays the world of computer science is more than ever important and present in everyone's life. For this reason, it's crucial for the teaching system to have the best
possible means to lead the students to the best possible comprehension and governance of this subject. \\
CodeKataBattle is a platform supposed to allow Educators to create coding tournaments in which students can compete, in teams or on their own, to improve their skills in any type of programming language.\\\\
In order to ensure that the system allows Educators to manage all the settings and rules of the tournaments (number of battles, allowed Students' team size, score assignment rules, proper programming language \dots), to which students can subscribe.\\
All the Students logged into the app receive a notification each time a tournament has been created.\\
Students involved in a tournament can create teams (according to the tournament's rules), and then it's time for them to start coding: through Git they will be allowed to receive the problem's text and to submit their solution, within a configured time range.\\
The solutions will then be evaluated, by the system or the Educator, and will contribute to defining the final rank of the tournament.\\\\
Their stats in tournaments will be public and visible in the account of a student, as well as their achieved badges: a badge is a reward that is created by an Educator, who defines the requirement(s) to gain it: the badges can be assigned to one or more students and are relative to a single tournament, at the end of which they are eventually assigned.

\section{Overall Description}
\subsection{Product Perspective}
\subsubsection{Scenarios}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{An Educator creates a tournament\\}An Educator wants to create a coding tournament to make his students train their
  coding skills: he signs in into the system and he clicks on the "My Tournaments" button on his home page, then he clicks on "Create new Tournament":
  at this point the Educator can set the name of the tournament the list of collaborators (Colleagues that can create battles in the context of that tournament) and a subscription
  deadline for the tudents who want to join the tournament, after that time the subscription will be closed and the tournament will result as started.\\
  When he clicks on confirm the tournament has finally been created: now all the students will be notified and can join it.\\
  \item \textbf{An Educator creates a battle\\}An Educator wants to create a new battle for the tournament: once he has signed in he can go in to "My Tournaments" section
  and select a started tournament.\\
  If the tournament has no ongoing battles the function "Create new battle" is enabled: the Educator can then manage the battle settings.
  In particular he has to configure:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The programming language(s) students are allowed to use for coding that the evaluating system will recognize
    \item The maximum number of students for each team that will compete in the battle
    \item The registration deadline for the battle
    \item The submission deadline for the solutions
    \item The evaluation system options (Totally automated, manual checking)
  \end{itemize}
  He has finally to submit the text of the problem for the battle: it will be automatically uploaded in a repo created by the system at the registration
  deadline and the students will be automatically given the link to see it and start coding.\\
  \newpage
  \item \textbf{An Educator creates a Badge\\}An Educator wants to create a gamification badge: badges exist in the context of a tournament, so the Educator clicks on an ongoing tournament
  in "My Tournaments" section and then on "Create a Badge".\\
  Once reached this section the Educator is shown the list of parameters offered by the system which represent properties regarding which conditions can be built, including values of commits number, code length, code speed, joined battles
  and so on; he also writes a brief description of the requirement in the dedicated section.
  Once the conditions are written the Educator uploads an image for the badge and gives it a name, and eventually clicks on "confirm": now the badge is avaiable for all students of that tournament.\\
  \item \textbf{A Students joins a tournament\\} Mark has been notified that a new tournament has been created and wants to join it: he can click on the notification, that will redirect him directly on the tournament page, or search for it by himself clicking on "Join a Tournament" in "My Tournaments"
  section of his homepage. 
  Once he has found the tournament he clicks join and he's in: he can now see the list of the incoming battles to join them on his own or with his team.\\
  \item \textbf{A Students joins a battle\\} Mark has seen that a battle is starting in a tournament he has joined and has decided to join it with 2 friends, that have also subscribed to the tournament.\\
  He selects the tournament from him ones list and then selects the battle: he can then see his team for the battle, to which he can invite people who has subsribed to the tournament pushing the '+' button, and a confirmation button.\\
  He invites his 2 friends selecting them from a list containing the subscribers and after some time he receives a notification that the invites have been accepted: in that moment he comes back to the battle page and sees his friend's name 
  appeared in his team: now he clicks on confirm and the registraton is confirmed, they have to wait for the beginning of the battle.
  \newpage 
  \item \textbf{A Student achieves a badge\\} Paul is competing in a tournament, last battle of which has just ended: since the Educator who has created the tournament defined a badge for the team 
  having committing the biggest number of times, the system verifies that condition and Paul is resulting as the gainer of the badge.\\
  The system then sends a notification to him: when he sees it he goes to his profile homepage and in "My Badges" section he sees the new badge he has achieved.\\
  Eventually, clicking on it, he can see the information about the badge, including the description of the requirement from which he is now able to know
  how he has gain the achievement.


\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Assumptions, dependencies and constraints}

\subsubsection{Domain Assumptions}
The following are the domain assumptions that need to be satisfied for the correct behaviour of CKB. Since those situations are out of the control of the system, they are taken as granted.\\\\
$[D1]$ User must have an internet connection.\\
$[D2]$ User must have a GitHub account.\\
$[D3]$ User must be able to push on GitHub by itself.\\
$[D4]$ Connection between systems must be reliable.\\

\section{Specific Requirements}

\subsection{User Interfaces}
In this section is presented the user interface through which both students and educators can:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Log in
    \item Sign Up
    \item Access personal dashboard
\end{itemize}
The needs of educators and students are not the same, therefore they are going to get access to different views:\\
Educators have access to specific views that allow them to create tournaments and battles, moreover, the creator of the tournament can grant access to other educators so that they can create their own battles within the tournament access has been granted for.\\
An user can be both student and educator: those users will be provided with a switch button available in the dashboard so that they can switch between the two profiles.
