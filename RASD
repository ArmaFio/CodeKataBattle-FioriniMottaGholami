\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Purpose}
The purpose of this document is to outline the functionalities and requirements of CodeKataBattle (CKB), a novel platform designed to facilitate the enhancement of students' software development skills through collaborative training on code katas. Educators leverage this platform to challenge and mentor students by creating code kata battles, where teams of students engage in friendly competitions to showcase and enhance their programming skills.


\subsection{Scope}
Nowadays the world of computer science is more than ever important and present in everyone's life: for this reason it's crucial for the teaching system to have the best
possible means to lead the students to the best possible comprehension and governance of this subject. \\
CodeKataBattle is a platform supposed to allow Educators to create coding tournaments in which students can compete, in teams or on their own, to improve their skills in any type of programming language.\\\\
In order to ensure that the system allows Educators to manage all the settings and rules of the tournaments (number of battles, allowed Students' teams size, score assignment rules, proper programming language \dots), to which students can subscribe.\\
All the Students logged into the app receive a notification each time a tournament has been created.\\
Students involved in a tournament can create teams (according to the tournament's rules), and then it's time for them to start coding: through Git they will be allowed to receive the problem's text and to submit their solution, within a configured time range.\\
The solutions will then be evaluated, by the system or the Educator, and will contribute to define the final rank of the tournament.\\\\
Their stats in tournaments will be public and visible in the account of a student, as well as their achieved badges: a badge is a reward which is created by an Educator, who defines the requirement(s) to gain it: the badges can be assigned to one or more students and are relative to a single tournament, at the end of which they are eventually assigned.\\\\\\

\subsection{Overview}
\subsubsection{Goals}
These are the goals that the system to be is supposed to achieve:\\\\
$[G1]$ Educators and students can subscribe to the application creating their personal account \\
$[G2]$ Educators create Tournaments in which students can compete \\
$[G3]$ Students subscribe to the tournaments \\
$[G4]$ Students compete, in teams or on their own, in many battles, the results of which will determine the final rank of the tournament  \\
$[G5]$ Students can reach achievements that permit them to gain badges for their account \\
$[G6]$ Educators create badges and define requirements to achieve them \\
\begin{itemize}
\item Skill Enhancement: Users, primarily students, want to improve their software development skills by actively participating in coding battles and honing their problem-solving abilities. 

\item Collaboration: Students aspire to collaborate with their peers to solve coding challenges as a team. This encourages cooperative learning and effective communication among team members.

\item Competition and Ranking: Users, including educators and students, desire a competitive element in software development exercises. They aim to compete with others and achieve high rankings based on their coding prowess.

\item Educational Engagement: Educators intend to create engaging and effective teaching environments, using code kata battles to educate and mentor their students in a practical and enjoyable manner.

\item Automated Assessment: All users seek an automated and objective method for assessing and scoring coding solutions. This provides fair and efficient evaluation, particularly in cases where a large number of students and teams are involved.

\end{itemize}
